  United States Africa Command (AFRICOM) is a unified combatant command of the
  United States Department of Defense responsible for military operations and
  coordination in Africa. AFRICOM's primary mission is to advance U.S. national
  security interests and promote regional stability through security
  cooperation, military assistance, and joint training exercises with African
  partner nations. This includes maintaining a strong presence in key areas of
  Africa to prevent and counter terrorism, piracy, and other transnational
  threats. AFRICOM also works to strengthen the capacity and capabilities of
  African militaries to address regional security challenges and promote peace
  and stability on the continent. Additionally, AFRICOM supports humanitarian
  and disaster relief efforts in Africa, providing assistance to countries in
  times of crisis.
